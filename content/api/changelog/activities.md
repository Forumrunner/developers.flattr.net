Now you can fetch a users [activities](http://developers.flattr.net/api/resources/activities/). We exclusively use [Activity Streams](http://activitystrea.ms/) feeds for this as there's no point in inventing yet another format for expressing the data. We support both the Atom-based XML variant and the newer JSON-based variant - pick the one you like best.
