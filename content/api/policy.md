title: REST API Policy
---

Flattr was founded by developers and hackers and we know that your apps
and hacks with our API will only help to promote more use of Flattr in
supporting content creators. We hope that common sense and good faith
will make up the basis for a great ecosystem and therefore we try to
keep the list of API rules as short as possible.

However, we reserve the right to change these policies and/or terminate
your API access at any time if we find it necessary for protecting our
users', partners', and own rights.

Current policies for using the Flattr API:

* Read and adhere to our [Terms of Use](https://flattr.com/terms) and
  [Privacy Policy](https://flattr.com/privacy).
* Always make sure to have our users' consent before acting on their
  behalf. Flattr is about money, don’t make your users think your messing
  around with their money.
* Comply with any requirements or restrictions imposed on content by
  respective owners (our users).
* Make it possible for users to revoke access to their Flattr account
  from within your app at any time.
* Make it clear in your app that it is using Flattr but is not an
  official Flattr application. Please read our guidelines on how to use
  the Flattr name and logos.
* Web integrations should have a link to [http://flattr.com](http://flattr.com).
* Our API has several functions (eg. revenue share, partner rights,
  etc.) which require special credentials to use. Please 
  [contact us](http://flattr.com/contact) at if you want to use them.

#### Name and logo guidelines

To avoid confusion for your users and ours, here are some simple
guidelines for how to use the Flattr name and logos in your application,
website or service. If you have any further questions, please [contact us](http://flattr.com/contact).

##### Do

* make it clear that your app is using Flattr, using appropriate
  explanation within the description or functionality of your
  application or site
* use Flattr in a referential phrase such as “powered by”, “connected
  to” or similar
* design your site, logos and titles with unique branding elements that
  are clearly distinct from Flattr
* ensure that any Flattr logos or titles are displayed less prominently
  than those of your application or site.

##### Don't

* imply false affiliation, sponsorship or partnership of your
  application or site with Flattr. For example, calling your app
  “aFlattr” or Flattapp is fine but calling it “Flattr for Amazon” is not.
* use Flattr logos in a disparaging or misleading manner.
