We offer several ways to communicate and integrate with differant parts
of [Flattr](http://flattr.com).

### REST API

Use our [REST API](/api) if you want to integrate with Flattr. It offers OAuth2
authentication of Flattr users, ways to create, delete and update things
and much more.

### Button

If you want to include Flattr buttons on your page check out the
[embedded button](/button) or the [auto-submit URL](/auto-submit) documentations.
