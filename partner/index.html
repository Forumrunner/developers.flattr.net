      <p>If you are Flattr partner and you have received a partner key you can use this documentation..</p>

<p>To apply for partnership please get in <a href="https://flattr.com/support/contact">contact</a> with us.</p>
<h3 id="community-partner-buttons">Community partner buttons</h3><h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>The community partner buttons mechanism is a way for communities to add Flattr buttons to all their users&#39; content without the user having to preregister at Flattr to get them.</p>

<p>The mechanism uses non-flattr user identifiers to identify ownership of the things and lets the user claim its things and flattrs by later confirming that its the rightful owner of that identifier.</p>

<p>Callbacks are supported for notifying partner sites when something happens to one of their unclaimed things - such as them receiving flattrs. That way partners can communicate what is happening to their users so that their users are aware that they have money to claim.</p>
<h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li>Auto-submit / Embedded buttons</li>
<li>Web Hook callbacks</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="auto-submit-/-embedded-buttons">Auto-submit / Embedded buttons</h4>
<p>The first step is to add a way for users to be able to flattr the content on the site. There&#39;s two ways to do this.</p>

<p>The best user experience is achieved by using our javascript based embedded buttons which embeds buttons as iframes through which logged in users can flattr right away.</p>

<p>If for any reason embedded buttons won&#39;t work one can instead use our static auto-submit to open a page on Flattr.com for the thing on which it can be flattred.</p>

<p>Through the auto-submit process (auto-submitting means that a Flattr thing is created automatically when the first flattr is made - they don&#39;t have to be presubmitted) the description of the thing is currently also added - the name, category, language etc.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong> - we&#39;re looking at moving away from auto-submit provided description data in the <em>future</em> and fetch the description of the thing from its URL instead - using <a href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> data or similar. Would be nice if partners kept this in mind when choosing URL:s for their things. Feedback is also welcome.</p>
<h4 id="embedded-buttons">Embedded buttons</h4>
<p><a href="/button">Embedded buttons</a> for community partners work the same way as a normal <a href="/auto-submit">auto-submitting</a> Flattr button.</p>

<p>The difference between normal buttons and the ones used by community partners is that community partners assigns an <code>owner</code> parameter instead of the <code>uid</code> parameter used by ordinary buttons. The owner parameter contains an identifier for a non-flattr user. See a list of supported identifiers in the section <em>&quot;Supported user identifiers&quot;</em> at the end of this document.</p>
<h4 id="static-auto-submit">Static auto-submit</h4>
<p>The static auto-submit is a link that redirects to either an existing thing or to a temporary page where the thing can be flattred and thus also created through the auto-submit.</p>

<p>The basic URL for the static auto-submit is <code>https://flattr.com/submit/auto</code> and to that a bunch of query parameters are added of which two are critical for community partners: The <code>url</code> and <code>owner</code> parameters. The auto-submit parameters for the thing description like <code>title</code> and <code>decription</code> are the same as for the button. See <a href="/button">embedded button documentation</a> for a full list.</p>
<h4 id="example:-auto-submit-a-url">Example: Auto-submit a URL</h4>
<p><code>https://flattr.com/submit/auto?url=http://example.com/&amp;owner=twitter:user:id:123&amp;title=Example</code></p>
<h3 id="web-hook-callbacks">Web Hook callbacks</h3>
<p>For partners to get notified when something happens to their site&#39;s unclaimed things we have added support for web hooks - this means that partners can pass the notification on to the owner of thing so that partners can be sure that the user knows about it.</p>

<p>A single web hook URL is registered with us and which events that should be sent to it. Whenever an event occurs we then do a POST-request to that URL with a form encoded body containing event specific parameters as well as a <code>_event</code> parameter indicating the type of event. Partner sites should always check the <code>_event</code> parameter prior to processing an event to be sure that they are processing the right event.</p>
<h3 id="supported-events">Supported events</h3><h4 id="unclaimed-thing-receives-a-pending-flattr">Unclaimed thing receives a pending flattr</h4>
<p><strong>Event name:</strong> <code>pendingclickcreate</code></p>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>thing_id</strong> - The numeric id of the thing that was clicked</li>
<li><strong>thing_owner_id</strong> - The full user identifier specified for the thing - will likely be the one specified by the partner in in Step 1.</li>
<li><strong>thing_clicks_total</strong> - The total amount of clicks after this click happened. (While hooks are likely to be executed in order - don&#39;t count on it)</li>
<li><strong>flattrer_username</strong> - The username of the user that did the flattr - or empty if the user flattrs anonymously</li>
<li><strong>claim_url</strong> - URL to a page on Flattr.com where the user can claim their things. If the owner was specified as an e-mail address then append the unhashed e-mail address to the claim url like &quot;/owner/foo%40example.com&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="partner-requirements">Partner requirements</h3>
<p>Community partner functionality is, due to its implementation, currently limited to selected partners. Partner registration is required for non-flattr user identifiers as well as callbacks to work. Please contact the Flattr team to get registered as a partner.</p>
<h3 id="supported-user-identifiers">Supported user identifiers</h3>
<ul>
<li>E-mail addresses, MD5 hashed. Eg: <code>email:05f8b3480b04f6a516bb1a46e556323c</code></li>
<li>Twitter user ids. Eg. <code>twitter:user:id:123</code></li>
<li>Partner ids. Eg. <code>partner:namespace:123</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="verifying-custom-identifiers">Verifying custom identifiers</h3>
<p>If we have arranged it so that you can verify that a given Flattr account is owned by a user on your system, you can use a simple API call to associate the two accounts. This will make all pending things associated with the user on your system to automatically be claimed by the Flattr account.</p>
<h5 >Parameters</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>identity</strong> - The URI that you want to associate with the Flattr account, e.g. &quot;partner:namespace:123&quot; where &quot;123&quot; is e.g. the ID number of a user on your system. Contact us if you do not know what your partner namespace is.</li>
</ul>
<h5 >Request</h5><pre class="highlight"><code>POST https://api.flattr.com/rest/v2/users/:username/verify
</code></pre><h5 >Verify an authenticated user</h5><pre class="highlight"><code>POST https://api.flattr.com/rest/v2/user/verify

<h5 >Errors</h5>
<ul>
<li><code>unauthorized</code>  (401 Unauthorized) - You are either not logged in, are providing an invalid identifier, or are not allowed to verify the provided identifier.</li>
